Limmer, MD\nMentor:  Todd Jenkins, MD\nEditor:  Pamela D. Berens, MD\nThe prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide, including among women of childbearing age, with an additional 150 million adult cases projected by 2030. Diabetes poses significant risks to pregnant women and developing fetuses. These risks can be minimized through effective contraception and appropriate preconception care. According to the 2016 U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraceptive Use, only non-hormonal birth control methods such as barrier methods and the Copper IUD can be used without restriction (MEC Category 1) in women with diabetes. Diabetes is an independent risk factor for micro- and macrovascular disease, and contraceptives that do not further raise these risks are preferred. At the same time, the risks of unplanned pregnancies, particularly in the setting of poor glycemic control, must be weighed against the risks of the contraceptive.\nThere is no indication for diabetes screening prior to the initiation of any form of contraception. Concern has been raised about the impact of hormonal contraception on glucose metabolism; however, no short or long-term effects have been proven. After detailed review of the diabetic patient\u2019s medical history, hormonal contraceptive methods can be considered.  Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) do not increase the risk of developing diabetes, even in patients with a history of gestational diabetes. CHC are safe and effective for women with diabetes not complicated by vascular disease (MEC Category 2). CHC can be prescribed in women with insulin-dependent diabetes unless they have severe microvascular disease such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, or the duration of disease is greater than 20 years. Estrogen-containing contraceptives are contraindicated in diabetic women with persistent hypertriglyceridemia or uncontrolled hypertension. Women with diabetes should have lipid and blood pressure screening prior to and after the initiation of CHC. CHC increase the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in diabetic women. And CHC are not recommended for diabetic women who have any additional cardiovascular risk factors, such as tobacco use. Women with type 2 diabetes frequently have obesity and other associated cardiovascular risk factors which may affect the decision to prescribe CHCs.\nProgesterone-only contraceptive methods, including pills, injections, implants, and the levonorgestrel IUD (LNG-IUD), are generally considered safe for women with diabetes. These methods have minimal impact on glucose metabolism, lipids, and thrombotic markers. An important exception to this is depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). The risks of DMPA in diabetics with vascular disease or diabetes duration > 20 years are thought to outweigh the benefits, due to decreased HDL levels in women who use DMPA. DMPA use under these circumstances is MEC category 3, and is generally not recommended.\nSterilization is an option for diabetic patients who have completed childbearing. Surgical complications can be reduced by optimizing glycemic control at the time of the procedure. Obese diabetic patients may benefit from endometrial suppression from hormonal contraception or the LNG-IUD, and should be advised on these benefits as part of sterilization counseling. \n  Condition Sub-Condition Cu-IUD LNG-IUD Implant DMPA POP CHC\n    I C I C I C I C I C I C\nDiabetes a) History of gestational disease 1 1 1 1 1 1*\nb) Non-vascular disease            \ni) Non-insulin dependent 1 2 2 2 2 2\nii) Insulin dependent 1 2 2 2 2 2\nc) Nephropathy/retinopathy/neuropathy\u2021 1 2 2 3 2 3/4*\nd) Other vascular disease or diabetes of >20 years\u2019 duration\u2021 1 2 2 3 2 3/4*\n1=no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method; 2=Advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks; 3=theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of the method; 4=unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used.*\n  Further Reading:\nCurtis KM, Jatlaoui TC, Tepper NK, et al.

Boozer, MD\nEditor:  Christopher M. Zahn, MD\nMentor:  Todd Jenkins, MD\nCardiovascular risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking and increasing age, and limit options for contraception, particularly hormonal methods.\nHypertension: Long-acting reversible methods, including implants and intrauterine systems, as well as progestin-only pills, do not appear to have increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in women with hypertension. Depo-medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) can generally be used in women with hypertension, except for those with severe hypertension or vascular disease (US Medical Eligibility Criteria (USMEC) Category 3). In women with hypertension, CHC use as associated with a higher risk of stroke and acute myocardial infarction compared to non-use. If CHC\u2019s are used, blood pressure should be measured before initiating combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs). In a systematic review, those patients who did not have blood pressure measurements before starting CHCs had a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke compared to women in whom blood pressure was measured. Women with hypertension (systolic BP of 140 \u2013 159 mm Hg or diastolic BP 90 \u2013 99 mm Hg) or those with adequately controlled hypertension should generally not use CHCs (USMEC Category 3). Women with severe hypertension (systolic \u2265 160 mm Hg or diastolic \u2265 100 mm Hg) should not use CHCs (USMEC Category 4).\nDiabetes: The levonorgestrel intrauterine system appears preferable, regardless of end-organ disease, and use of the copper IUD is unrestricted. DMPA should generally not be used in women with complicated diabetes. Neither CHC nor progestin only contraception (POC) appears to affect glycemic control or disease progression in diabetic patients or in patients with a history of gestational diabetes. However, CHCs should not be used in patients with complicated diabetes. The contraceptive implant is considered may cause mild insulin resistance, but has not been shown to have an effect on serum glucose levels in normal women. Additionally, the implant has no adverse effects on the lipid profile.\nObesity: The levonorgestrel intrauterine system should be considered in obese women because it offers protection against their increased risk for endometrial abnormalities. Obese adolescent DMPA users are at increased risk for weight gain compared to other users and non-users. Despite concerns regarding decreased efficacy, both CHC and POC are generally safe in women with BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. Limited evidence demonstrates that obese women who use CHC\u2019s do not have a higher risk for acute myocardial infarction or stroke compared to non-CHC users. The advantages of using hormonal contraception generally outweigh the risks. Nevertheless, obese women using CHC are at small increased risk of venous thromboembolism, so use of POC is encouraged.\nSmoking: POC and non-hormonal contraception do not have these risks and are preferred. CHC use is associated with both an age and dose-related increased risk of myocardial infarction, so they should not be used in patients who smoke and are 35 or older.\nIncreased age: All contraceptive methods are generally safe in healthy, non-smoking, non-obese women older than age 35. Due to the increased risk of VTE associated with obesity and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with age, CHC should only be used in women 40 or older in the absence of these co-morbidities.\nMultiple risk factors: Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper IUD, barrier methods, and female and male sterilization. These methods, as well emergency contraception, are safe and can be used without restriction in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Generally, POCs and non-hormonal contraception represent a safe alternative, although DMPA should be used with caution. CHC should be used with caution, if at all, in any patient with two or more risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease.\n""",Office Practice,1/18/2017,https://s3.amazonaws.com/nareta-articles/audio/575f211362db940300ea04e2/c2GefK8fabVa1tM9XZQB.mp3, 4:36,https://exxcellence.org/pearls-of-exxcellence/list-of-pearls/contraception-in-women-with-cardiovascular-risk-factors,"The text discusses the impact of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and age on contraceptive options for women.

Neither CHC nor progestin only contraception (POC) appears to affect glycemic control or disease progression in diabetic patients or in patients with a history of gestational diabetes. However, CHCs should not be used in patients with complicated diabetes. The contraceptive implant is considered may cause mild insulin resistance, but has not been shown to have an effect on serum glucose levels in normal women. Additionally, the implant has no adverse effects on the lipid profile. Obesity: The levonorgestrel intrauterine system should be considered in obese women because it offers protection against their increased risk for endometrial abnormalities. Obese adolescent DMPA users are at increased risk for weight gain compared to other users and non-users. Despite concerns regarding decreased efficacy, both CHC and POC are generally safe in women with BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. Limited evidence demonstrates that obese women who use CHC’s do not have a higher risk for acute myocardial infarction or stroke compared to non-CHC users. The advantages of using hormonal contraception generally outweigh the risks. Nevertheless, obese women using CHC are at small increased risk of venous thromboembolism, so use of POC is encouraged. Smoking: POC and non-hormonal contraception do not have these risks and are preferred. CHC use is associated with both an age and dose-related increased risk of myocardial infarction, so they should not be used in patients who smoke and are 35 or older. Increased age: All contraceptive methods are generally safe in healthy, non-smoking, non-obese women older than age 35. Due to the increased risk of VTE associated with obesity and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with age, CHC should only be used in women 40 or older in the absence of these co-morbidities. Multiple risk factors: Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper IUD, barrier methods, and female and male sterilization. These methods, as well emergency contraception, are safe and can be used without restriction in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Generally, POCs and non-hormonal contraception represent a safe alternative, although DMPA should be used with caution. CHC should be used with caution, if at all, in any patient with two or more risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease."

Strand, MD\nEditor:  Pamela D. Berens, MD\nInteractions between hormonal contraceptives and other medications can cause alteration of therapeutic medication level, increased toxicity, and decreased contraceptive efficacy. Combined hormonal contraceptives include products with estrogen and progestin, including oral contraceptives, hormonal patches, and vaginal rings. Progestin only contraceptives (POCs) include progestin only pills (POPs), injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), etonorgestrel implants, and levonorgestrel IUDs. Although some medications have been shown to decrease efficacy of CHCs and POCs, the vast majority do not. CHCs, POPs and progestin released by the implant are metabolized via the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce enzymes in this system pose the potential for drug interactions. Some antiretrovirals (ARVs), antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and antibiotics are metabolized via this pathway. The levonorgestrel IUD primarily provides contraception through local endometrial effect, so interactions based on hepatic metabolism are not anticipated.\nThe ARVs with the most significant concern are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (specifically efavirenz), ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, and protease inhibitors without ritonavir. These interactions might alter safety or decrease overall effectiveness of both the hormonal contraceptive and the ARV drug. This potential decrease in contraceptive efficacy may be less likely with DMPA than other non IUD POCs due to the higher dose of DMPA.  Generally, ARV therapy while using a CHC may decrease contraceptive efficacy. If a woman on ARV treatment chooses CHCs, a preparation containing a minimum of 30 \u00b5g ethinyl estradiol should be used. Use of fosamprenavir and CHCs may lead to reduced efficacy of the ARV therapy and for this specific medication, the risks of CHC use may outweigh benefits. Atazanavir may increase ethinyl estradiol levels and could result in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Dual contraception (correct and consistent use of condoms with an additional method) is recommended to decrease HIV transmission risk and compensate for possible reduced contraceptive efficacy. There do not appear to be drug interactions between ARVs and IUDs (levonorgestrel or non-hormonal).\nAmong AEDs, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital are the most potent enzyme inducers. Increased sex hormone binding globulin noted with these medications could reduce the level of free and biologically active hormone. Most research regarding the impact of AEDs on contraceptive metabolism has focused on enhanced estrogen metabolism and reduced efficacy, though some research suggests progestin reduction. Other AED drugs such as topiramate, felbamate, and oxcarbazepine are less potent enzyme inducers but may also decrease effectiveness of CHCs, POPs and the etonorgestrel implant. Effectiveness of DMPA does not appear reduced.  Use of these contraceptive methods may decrease the plasma levels of some AEDs, adversely affecting seizure control and potentially requiring an increase in AED dose. Continuous use may avoid fluctuations in serum AED levels and facilitate seizure control. The CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for contraceptive use recommend against the use of CHCs, POPs, and the etonorgestrel implant in patients requiring long term enzyme inducing AEDs. If a CHC is chosen, a minimum 30 \u00b5g of ethinyl estradiol should be used. No drug interactions have been reported in women on AEDs using levonorgestrel IUDs.\nRifampin, an antibacterial used to treat tuberculosis and Neisseria meningitidis, is the only antibiotic rated as MEC category 3 (a condition for which risks usually outweigh advantages) for use with CHC, POP, and etonorgestrel implants. Alternate contraception should be considered for long-term users.

Hypertension is a risk factor for perioperative cardiovascular events including myocardial ischemia, infarction, and heart failure. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for intraoperative exaggerated hemodynamic lability, in addition to exacerbation of pre-existing end organ damage. Induction of anesthesia triggers sympathetic activation that may raise systemic blood pressure (BP) by 20 to 30 mm Hg in normotensive patients, and up to 90 mm Hg in untreated patients.

During surgery, they have metabolic stressors from the stress response and resultant increase in catabolism, altered nutritional status, changes in circulation, immobility, and glucose and electrolyte derangements. These conditions lead to higher morbidity and mortality, including wound infection, sepsis, acute renal injury, soft tissue and nerve injuries which may go unrecognized, delayed wound healing, and exacerbation of underlying comorbidities.\nOne in 11 persons worldwide now has diabetes. Those with risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and family history can be screened pre-operatively. Those with known disease should have an assessment of the chronic complications of diabetes and baseline laboratory evaluations including an ECG, serum creatinine, and blood glucose. The effectiveness of long-term control can be assessed with measurement of serum Hgb A1c.\nCare coordination with the patient\u2019s primary care provider or endocrinologist and preoperative anesthesia consultation will aid in surgical preparation. The patient should be included in the discussions regarding care specific to their diabetes and the planned surgery. The patient should maintain a predominantly euglycemic state in the weeks before the surgery.\nThe goal for the day of surgery is to avoid hypoglycemia (e.g., <120 mg/dL) and excessive hyperglycemia (e.g., <150 mg/dL). Patients with Type 1 diabetes may enter a ketoacidotic state even at lower levels of hyperglycemia. Patients with either type of diabetes are not candidates for carbohydrate loading with Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocols.\nOral hypoglycemics and long-acting insulin should be withheld the morning of surgery. Metformin should be withheld for 48 hours prior to surgery due to the risk of metabolic acidosis. The patient should be placed on a variable rate intravenous infusion of insulin if they will miss more than one meal. Type 1 diabetics should be maintained with a basal rate. Insulin infusion is preferred as it offers more predictable effects than subcutaneous administration. Target blood glucose levels are not firmly established, but should be within the range of 80-140 mg/dL preoperatively and 140-200 intra- and post-operatively. Mild hyperglycemia is associated with better outcomes than true normoglycemia.\nDelayed gastric emptying may be present in the diabetic patient.

It emphasizes the importance of pre-operative screening, maintaining euglycemia, glucose control strategies, and considerations for surgical techniques and anesthesia. The text also mentions the role of diabetes specialists in post-operative care and the importance of self-management post-surgery.","Patients with diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular, renal, and neuropathic complications. During surgery, they have metabolic stressors from the stress response and resultant increase in catabolism, altered nutritional status, changes in circulation, immobility, and glucose and electrolyte derangements. These conditions lead to higher morbidity and mortality, including wound infection, sepsis, acute renal injury, soft tissue and nerve injuries which may go unrecognized, delayed wound healing, and exacerbation of underlying comorbidities. One in 11 persons worldwide now has diabetes. Those with risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and family history can be screened pre-operatively. Those with known disease should have an assessment of the chronic complications of diabetes and baseline laboratory evaluations including an ECG, serum creatinine, and blood glucose. The effectiveness of long-term control can be assessed with measurement of serum Hgb A1c. Care coordination with the patient's primary care provider or endocrinologist and preoperative anesthesia consultation will aid in surgical preparation. The patient should be included in the discussions regarding care specific to their diabetes and the planned surgery. The patient should maintain a predominantly euglycemic state in the weeks before the surgery. The goal for the day of surgery is to avoid hypoglycemia (e.g., <120 mg/dL) and excessive hyperglycemia (e.g., <150 mg/dL). Patients with Type 1 diabetes may enter a ketoacidotic state even at lower levels of hyperglycemia. Patients with either type of diabetes are not candidates for carbohydrate loading with Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocols. Oral hypoglycemics and long-acting insulin should be withheld the morning of surgery. Metformin should be withheld for 48 hours prior to surgery due to the risk of metabolic acidosis. The patient should be placed on a variable rate intravenous infusion of insulin if they will miss more than one meal. Type 1 diabetics should be maintained with a basal rate. Insulin infusion is preferred as it offers more predictable effects than subcutaneous administration. Target blood glucose levels are not firmly established, but should be within the range of 80-140 mg/dL preoperatively and 140-200 intra- and post-operatively. Mild hyperglycemia is associated with better outcomes than true normoglycemia. Delayed gastric emptying may be present in the diabetic patient. Measures should be taken to ensure gastric motility which could include medications such as metoclopramide. Nausea and vomiting may contribute further to electrolyte disturbances and difficulties in glucose control. Glucose control decreases rates of surgical site infection. Choice of route for surgery should include considerations for impaired wound healing, so minimally invasive techniques, particularly the vaginal approach, are ideal.

Polyhydramnios is associated with increased risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm birth, macrosomia, malpresentation, umbilical cord prolapse, abruption, uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage, and other adverse outcomes.

Evaluation includes a comprehensive ultrasound to assess for anomalies and hydrops. Other testing should include diabetes and antibody screening, rapid plasma reagin (RPR), parvovirus, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) when indicated. Genetic evaluation may be considered to evaluate for aneuploidy, especially when polyhydramnios is severe, is diagnosed prior to 24 weeks, or when coexisting fetal anomalies or fetal growth restriction are identified.\nAntenatal testing should be initiated at 28-32 weeks gestation along with serial ultrasound evaluation to monitor amniotic fluid levels and fetal growth.\nIn pregnancies less than 32 weeks gestation, use of a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor (e.g. indomethacin) can be considered for 48 hours if significant maternal symptoms are present. Use of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors for more than 48 hours should involve input from high risk pregnancy consultants.

Up to 4% of women have a primary CMV infection during pregnancy. CMV may present as a mononucleosis-like illness, although most women are asymptomatic.\nVertical transmission occurs in approximately 30-40% of cases of primary maternal infection. The frequency of vertical transmission increases with gestational age, though the most severe congenital CMV cases usually occur with primary infection in the first trimester.\nTwelve to 18% of infected fetuses have evidence of infection at birth and up to 25% have sequelae including small for gestational age, microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatitis, chorioretinitis, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 30% of infants with severe infection die, and the majority of survivors have severe neurologic morbidity. Infected infants who are asymptomatic at birth remain at risk for developing neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\nSecondary maternal infections occur from reactivation or reinfection with a new CMV strain. The vertical transmission rate is up to 2%. In these cases, most newborns are asymptomatic at birth. Congenital deafness is the most common severe complication.\nTesting pregnant women for CMV is indicated in women with mononucleosis-like illness or when fetal CMV infection is suspected based on suggestive sonographic findings such as intracranial, abdominal or liver calcifications, hepatosplenomegaly, echogenic bowel, fetal growth restriction, cerebral ventriculomegaly, microcephaly, ascites or hydrops. These findings are non-specific.\nUniversal screening for CMV in pregnancy is not recommended. Seronegative childcare workers and families with young children are at risk for seroconversion. Measures to prevent CMV infection including frequent hand-washing may be discussed, although no measures can eliminate risk and the efficacy of such practices is unproven.\nPrimary maternal infection is diagnosed by testing samples drawn 3-4 weeks apart for anti-CMV IgG and noting seroconversion through detection of antibodies in a previously seronegative woman or a greater than four-fold increase in titer. In the absence of documented seroconversion or significant titer increase, the presence of anti-CMV IgG and anti-CMV IgM may represent primary or secondary infection. Many women with anti-CMV IgM will not have primary infection, but rather a re-exposure, a reactivation, or a false positive result. CMV IgG avidity testing is useful in these cases. During acute primary CMV infection, low avidity immature anti-CMV IgG is produced. Two to four months later, high avidity anti-CMV IgG is produced. Patients less than 20 weeks gestation with high avidity anti-CMV IgG are unlikely to have had primary infection during pregnancy. Presence of low avidity anti-CMV IgG suggests recent primary infection.\nPrenatal testing should be offered when CMV infection is suspected. Referral to a maternal fetal specialist should be considered. Amniocentesis is ideally performed after 21 weeks gestation and at least six weeks after maternal infection. Amniotic fluid is sent for PCR testing to detect CMV DNA. Serial ultrasound evaluations are recommended to monitor fetal growth and assess for features of fetal CMV infection. Normal ultrasound does not exclude risk for sequelae or neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\nTreatment for maternal infection is supportive.

Twin gestation comprises 3% of all live births; only 20% are monochorionic. Nearly all are diamnionic.  Monoamniotic twinning is rare. The natural incidence is 1 in 10,000 and is increasing due to the use of assisted reproductive technology.  The risk for fetal loss and long-term morbidity in monochorionic twins is significantly higher than dichorionic twins, with a 3- fold to 4-fold increase in intrauterine demise.   Shared circulation due to placental vascular anastomoses increases the risk of intrauterine demise.  Complications unique to monochorionic twins include twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and discordant growth, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS), and twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence. Major structural anomalies are more frequently diagnosed in monochorionic twins and can negatively impact the outcome of the co-twin.\nEarly diagnosis of chorionicity and amnionicity is made with ultrasonography. Accuracy is highest when ultrasound is performed in the first or early second trimester.  If two placentas or differing fetal sex is seen on ultrasound, then the pregnancy must be dichorionic.  If only one placenta is seen, the presence of an extension of chorionic tissue into the inter-twin membrane suggests dichorionicity.  This is referred to as the twin peak or lambda sign.  The absence of an extension of chorionic tissue into the inter-twin membrane suggests monochorionicity.  The absence of an inter-twin membrane suggests monoamnionicity.\nOnce a diagnosis of monochorionicity has been established, ultrasound surveillance usually begins at 16 weeks gestation and is performed every 2 weeks until delivery.  Monitoring of amniotic fluid and the presence of fluid in each twin\u2019s bladder can help to diagnose TTTS.

Although optimal management remains unknown, it has become standard of care to offer inpatient management starting at 24 to 28 weeks gestation.  These patients typically undergo daily fetal surveillance, regular growth assessment, and delivery between 32 to 34 weeks gestation by cesarean.\nMedical complications are more common in women with twins than singleton gestations.

The monoamnionic subtype of twins carries the highest risk with perinatal mortality, up to 80%, mainly due to cord entanglement. Although optimal management remains unknown, it has become standard of care to offer inpatient management starting at 24 to 28 weeks gestation. These patients typically undergo daily fetal surveillance, regular growth assessment, and delivery between 32 to 34 weeks gestation by cesarean. Medical complications are more common in women with twins than singleton gestations. Women with twins are at increased risk of hyperemesis, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders including preeclampsia, anemia, hemorrhage, cesarean delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage. Management of these conditions are the same as with singleton gestations."

It is reasonable to consider vaginal delivery for patients with no other contraindications to vaginal delivery who have either a monochorionic/diamniotic or dichorionic/diamniotic gestation if the presenting twin (Twin A) is in vertex presentation.  If twin A is non-vertex, then cesarean delivery is indicated. \nFor non-vertex second twin, the potential options for delivery include internal podalic version with vaginal breech extraction, external cephalic version followed by vaginal delivery, or cesarean delivery. There is a higher incidence of complications and emergency cesarean delivery associated with external cephalic version of a second twin compared to vaginal breech extraction, so breech extraction is preferred. Typical eligibility requirements for breech extraction include the pregnancy be > 28 weeks gestational age, EFW of the non-vertex second twin should be >1500 grams, and if the presenting twin is smaller, the fetal weight discordance should be <20-25%. Given the margin of error in ultrasonography it is reasonable to use 1800-2000 grams as a lower limit threshold; however an EFW between 1500-3500 grams is acceptable.\nStudies suggest increased neonatal morbidity associated with discordant routes of delivery for twins (vaginal/cesarean vs. vaginal/vaginal or cesarean delivery for both). Active management of delivery of the second twin is strongly recommended as it has been shown to significantly decrease discordant delivery and neonatal morbidity.  The patient should be adequately counseled and consent obtained. The patient should have IV access, continuous fetal monitoring and adequate anesthesia (regional preferred). Labor progress should be monitored closely. An anesthesia provider should be present at time of delivery.  It is recommended that delivery occur in the operating suite in the event that an emergent cesarean delivery is indicated. Ultrasonography should be available to determine fetal presentation of twin B following delivery of twin A.\nIf twin B is vertex and fetal heart tones reassuring, vaginal delivery may proceed.

Cesarean delivery is required for monochorionic/monoamniotic twin gestations. It is reasonable to consider vaginal delivery for patients with no other contraindications to vaginal delivery who have either a monochorionic/diamniotic or dichorionic/diamniotic gestation if the presenting twin (Twin A) is in vertex presentation. If twin A is non-vertex, then cesarean delivery is indicated. For non-vertex second twin, the potential options for delivery include internal podalic version with vaginal breech extraction, external cephalic version followed by vaginal delivery, or cesarean delivery. There is a higher incidence of complications and emergency cesarean delivery associated with external cephalic version of a second twin compared to vaginal breech extraction, so breech extraction is preferred. Typical eligibility requirements for breech extraction include the pregnancy be > 28 weeks gestational age, EFW of the non-vertex second twin should be >1500 grams, and if the presenting twin is smaller, the fetal weight discordance should be <20-25%. Given the margin of error in ultrasonography it is reasonable to use 1800-2000 grams as a lower limit threshold; however an EFW between 1500-3500 grams is acceptable. Studies suggest increased neonatal morbidity associated with discordant routes of delivery for twins (vaginal/cesarean vs. vaginal/vaginal or cesarean delivery for both). Active management of delivery of the second twin is strongly recommended as it has been shown to significantly decrease discordant delivery and neonatal morbidity. The patient should be adequately counseled and consent obtained. The patient should have IV access, continuous fetal monitoring and adequate anesthesia (regional preferred). Labor progress should be monitored closely. An anesthesia provider should be present at time of delivery. It is recommended that delivery occur in the operating suite in the event that an emergent cesarean delivery is indicated. Ultrasonography should be available to determine fetal presentation of twin B following delivery of twin A. If twin B is vertex and fetal heart tones reassuring, vaginal delivery may proceed. If Twin B is non-vertex, breech extraction is preferred and should be committed to quickly, prior to the cervix beginning to contract. If twin B is frank or complete breech and fetal heart tones are reassuring, it is acceptable to allow maternal expulsive forces to facilitate engagement of the presenting part into the pelvis prior to amniotomy, and then proceed with standard maneuvers of breech delivery.

Lawson, MD\nMentor: Nancy D. Gaba, MD\nApproved:  11/3/15\nPlacental abruption complicates 0.5 to 1% of pregnancies, but very rarely results in fetal demise.  Fetuses that survive are at increased risk of significant morbidity. Management must address the following: maternal and fetal status, severity of the abruption, and gestational age/viability of the fetus. When placental abruption results in fetal demise, there should be significant concern that the abruption is severe and potentially life threatening to the mother as well.\nThe initial evaluation needs to include a comprehensive history and physical exam to identify causes of abruption that could impact management like hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, abdominal trauma, or cocaine use. The mother\u2019s hemodynamic status must be closely evaluated and monitored. Fetal demise should raise concern for significant hemorrhage. Two large-bore intravenous catheters should be placed and volume resuscitation initiated with crystalloid or uncrossmatched blood as clinically warranted. Blood samples should be sent for type and crossmatch, complete blood count, fibrinogen, and PT/aPTT to assess for acute blood loss anemia and coagulopathy. Elevated d-dimers may be associated with severe placental abruption, but are not diagnostic. Consumptive coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation) is more common with concealed abruption.\nThe patient should also be assessed for vaginal bleeding and for concealed retroplacental hemorrhage. Bleeding per vagina can be assessed objectively with either a volumetric container or by weighing items used to absorb blood such as underpads and linen. Concealed hemorrhage may be assessed serially by ultrasonography or measuring fundal height. Ultrasonography should not be used to exclude placental abruption, as the appearance of clot on ultrasound is similar to the echotexture of placenta. Ultrasonography should be performed to determine fetal presentation and confirm fetal demise.\nMany patients who have experienced a severe abruption and fetal demise have regular contractions on tocodynamometer and may deliver spontaneously. Vaginal delivery is the preferred route as surgery is often complicated by coagulopathy. Prior classical cesarean is not an absolute contraindication for vaginal delivery, but the decision and counseling should weigh the risks of surgical hemorrhage due to coagulopathy against the risks of uterine rupture (4-9% with prior classical cesarean section). Amniotomy or oxytocin augmentation will usually result in a rapid vaginal delivery. During labor, ongoing blood losses should be noted and replaced as indicated.\nIf vaginal delivery is contraindicated for obstetric indications such as transverse lie, profound maternal hemorrhage with hypovolemia unresponsive to resuscitation, or a high clinical suspicion for uterine rupture, there is a significant risk of intraoperative hemorrhage due to atony or coagulopathy that can lead to peripartum hysterectomy. If surgical delivery is necessary, marked thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 50,000/\u00b5L) or hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen less than 100 mg/dL) should be corrected with platelet or cryoprecipitate infusion to mitigate the risks of intraoperative hemorrhage. Packed red blood cells should be transfused to maintain the hematocrit between 25 and 30%.  Massive transfusion protocols should be initiated if necessary.\nCouvelaire uterus, widespread extravasation of blood into the myometrium and beneath the serosa, may be encountered but is not necessarily an indication for hysterectomy.

Two large-bore intravenous catheters should be placed and volume resuscitation initiated with crystalloid or uncrossmatched blood as clinically warranted. Blood samples should be sent for type and crossmatch, complete blood count, fibrinogen, and PT/aPTT to assess for acute blood loss anemia and coagulopathy. Elevated d-dimers may be associated with severe placental abruption, but are not diagnostic. Consumptive coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation) is more common with concealed abruption. The patient should also be assessed for vaginal bleeding and for concealed retroplacental hemorrhage. Bleeding per vagina can be assessed objectively with either a volumetric container or by weighing items used to absorb blood such as underpads and linen. Concealed hemorrhage may be assessed serially by ultrasonography or measuring fundal height. Ultrasonography should not be used to exclude placental abruption, as the appearance of clot on ultrasound is similar to the echotexture of placenta. Ultrasonography should be performed to determine fetal presentation and confirm fetal demise. Many patients who have experienced a severe abruption and fetal demise have regular contractions on tocodynamometer and may deliver spontaneously. Vaginal delivery is the preferred route as surgery is often complicated by coagulopathy. Prior classical cesarean is not an absolute contraindication for vaginal delivery, but the decision and counseling should weigh the risks of surgical hemorrhage due to coagulopathy against the risks of uterine rupture (4-9% with prior classical cesarean section). Amniotomy or oxytocin augmentation will usually result in a rapid vaginal delivery. During labor, ongoing blood losses should be noted and replaced as indicated. If vaginal delivery is contraindicated for obstetric indications such as transverse lie, profound maternal hemorrhage with hypovolemia unresponsive to resuscitation, or a high clinical suspicion for uterine rupture, there is a significant risk of intraoperative hemorrhage due to atony or coagulopathy that can lead to peripartum hysterectomy. If surgical delivery is necessary, marked thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 50,000/µL) or hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen less than 100 mg/dL) should be corrected with platelet or cryoprecipitate infusion to mitigate the risks of intraoperative hemorrhage. Packed red blood cells should be transfused to maintain the hematocrit between 25 and 30%. Massive transfusion protocols should be initiated if necessary. Couvelaire uterus, widespread extravasation of blood into the myometrium and beneath the serosa, may be encountered but is not necessarily an indication for hysterectomy. Rh immunoglobulin should be administered per protocol."

Chesney Thompson, MD\nEditor: Martin E. Olsen, MD\nPostoperative ileus is a loss of motility or abnormal peristalsis after surgery causing a functional obstruction without mechanical blockage.  A physiologic ileus can occur up to 72 hours after surgery.  When the ileus is prolonged, creating patient discomfort, intolerance of oral intake, and prolonged hospitalization, it must then, however, be differentiated from other postoperative complications and managed appropriately.\nMany risk factors for postoperative ileus exist.  These include: prolonged abdominal or pelvic surgery, laparotomy (which necessitates more bowel manipulation), lower gastrointestinal surgery, intra-abdominal infection, intraoperative bleeding, and narcotic use.\nA patient with ileus after surgery typically complains of bloating, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, intolerance of oral diet, and absent or minimal flatus.  These symptoms are consistent with a differential diagnosis that includes ileus, small bowel obstruction, bowel injury, intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding, or intra-abdominal abscess.  Laboratory evaluation is warranted; this includes a complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, amylase, lipase, and liver function tests.

A physiologic ileus can occur up to 72 hours after surgery. When the ileus is prolonged, creating patient discomfort, intolerance of oral intake, and prolonged hospitalization, it must then, however, be differentiated from other postoperative complications and managed appropriately. Many risk factors for postoperative ileus exist. These include: prolonged abdominal or pelvic surgery, laparotomy (which necessitates more bowel manipulation), lower gastrointestinal surgery, intra-abdominal infection, intraoperative bleeding, and narcotic use. A patient with ileus after surgery typically complains of bloating, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, intolerance of oral diet, and absent or minimal flatus. These symptoms are consistent with a differential diagnosis that includes ileus, small bowel obstruction, bowel injury, intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding, or intra-abdominal abscess. Laboratory evaluation is warranted; this includes a complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, amylase, lipase, and liver function tests.

Patients may benefit from \u201cbridging\u201d therapy, in which a short-acting anticoagulant (low-molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or unfractionated heparin) is used in the perioperative period. The decision to use bridging therapy depends on individualized risk assessment, including patient preferences and the potential use of multidisciplinary input.\nRisk Stratification\nRisk assessment may include use of an instrument such as the CHADS2 (Congestive Heart Failure-Hypertension-Age-Diabetes-Stroke) score to predict risk of stroke. Risk of bleeding and of thromboembolism may also be predicted; Tables 2-4 in ACOG Committee Opinion # 610 define risk and the associated recommended management protocols for perioperative anticoagulation. Other considerations include the type of thromboembolism (arterial or venous) and individual patient characteristics (such as age, BMI, mobility) which may upgrade or downgrade recommendations. Patients with a personal history of thromboembolism more than 12 months before their planned surgery may avoid anticoagulation unless the patient has an active malignancy. Patients with a mechanical heart valve may be at high risk; consultation with a cardiologist to define risk and management is generally advised.\nBridging Protocols\nBridging protocols may incorporate LMWH or unfractionated heparin, and are generally divided into low- and high-dose regimens. Low-dose is considered \u201cprophylactic\u201d, involving once- (e.g. 40 mg enoxaparin) or twice-daily (e.g. 30 mg enoxaparin) LMWH or subcutaneous heparin (5,000 \u2013 7,500 IU twice daily). High dose (\u201ctherapeutic\u201d) regimens include LMWH (1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) or intravenous unfractionated heparin to achieve an APTT 1.5 \u2013 2 times control. Therapeutic dosing regimens have been the most widely studied for bridging therapy.\nPreoperative Timing\nVitamin K antagonist (warfarin) therapy is typically stopped 5 days before surgery, and bridging therapy (if used) is started. Patients with higher INR on vitamin K antagonist therapy may need to stop earlier. INR should be checked the day before surgery; if not normalized, oral Vitamin K (1 -2 mg) is recommended. When using bridging therapy, therapeutic dosing is stopped 24 hours before surgery when using LMWH, and 6 hours for intravenous unfractionated heparin. Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin should be stopped the night before the procedure. Thromboprophylaxis should be administered with pneumatic compression devises and possibly prophylactic heparin dosing depending on the risks of thromboembolism and bleeding.\nPostoperative Timing\nIf adequate hemostasis is present, vitamin K antagonist therapy may begin 12 \u2013 24 hours postoperatively. Patients receiving bridge therapy with therapeutic dosing, and who have undergone surgery with a high risk of bleeding, may re-start therapy 48 \u2013 72 hours postoperatively. Bridging therapy is continued until the INR reaches a therapeutic range.\nAntiplatelet Therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel)\nBridging therapy is typically not recommended for patients on antiplatelet agents. For patients using aspirin at high risk of a cardiovascular event, aspirin should be continued because the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. Patients at low risk should stop aspirin 7 \u2013 10 days before surgery and re-start it with a similar schedule to the vitamin K antagonist recommendations. Clopidogrel should be stopped 5 \u2013 7 days before surgery, and therapeutic dose re-started 12 \u2013 24 hours postoperatively.\nNewer Agents\nLess is known about perioperative management for patents using target-specific anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran. Possible schemes include stopping therapy 5 days before surgery with bridging therapy, or stopping 1 \u2013 5 days before without bridging therapy. Consultation with a hematologist, cardiologist, or primary care provider may be beneficial for managing these patients.\nEmergent Surgery\nWomen receiving vitamin K antagonists may require vitamin K (1 \u2013 2 mg) to reverse the anticoagulation effects and decrease the delay for surgery.

Rapid intra-op or post-op hemodynamic instability may be evidence of major vascular injury and rapid intervention is mandatory. Mesh erosion may occur despite appropriate mesh placement. Evidence of bladder or urethral erosion includes hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, and pain. Vaginal erosion symptoms include pelvic pain, discharge, and dyspareunia. Mesh excision is often required, although conservative approaches may appropriate. Vaginal injury is more common with TOT due to the course of the needle near the vaginal fornices. Primary repair intra-operatively resolves most problems. Pain/Nerve injury is more common in with TOT due to puncture of the muscular pelvic sidewall. Initial management is conservative. Mesh excision may be required for refractory cases. Bowel Injury is a rare but potentially catastrophic complication that remains hard to recognize intra-operatively. TVT and TOT are generally safe and effective minimally invasive interventions for stress incontinence. Careful adherence to correct surgical technique and respect for pelvic anatomy will help prevent most complications. Appropriate and timely intervention will minimize the long-term sequelae when complications do occur."

Headache is the most common symptom, preceding seizure by hours to days before presentation. Additionally, discharge instructions may lack information about the signs, symptoms, and possibility of postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia. As a result, only one third of these patients seek medical care and when sought it is often from primary or emergency department health care providers who may be less familiar with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Moreover, many women who present with postpartum eclampsia have not had signs nor symptoms of preeclampsia pre or intrapartum. The differential diagnoses of postpartum seizures includes hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accident, cerebral venous thrombosis, infection, metabolic abnormalities, and drug intoxication or withdrawal.\nEclampsia is diagnosed clinically based on generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which are sometimes accompanied by visual disturbances, headaches, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain and altered mental status. Hyper-reflexia and non-dependent edema may be present. Laboratory abnormalities may include elevated liver transaminases, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperuricemia. Alternatively, laboratory values may be minimally abnormal. Overt proteinuria and severe range blood pressures are less prevalent in late onset postpartum eclampsia, which also may confound the diagnosis. Electroencephalogram has limited value in distinguishing seizures due to eclampsia from other causes. MRI can support the diagnosis and rule out other causes of new onset convulsions.

McAlister, MD\nThe postmenopausal vulva is characterized by a decline in skin barrier function associated with aging and estrogen deficiency that contributes to increased susceptibility to a variety of conditions. The most common symptoms are itching and burning. Women often delay care and present with a long history of ineffective treatment for presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis. Diagnosis involves recognizing the typical appearance of common conditions and identifying when biopsy should be performed. Therapy is targeted at the underlying etiology.\nWhite lesions are seen with lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, atrophic vulvitis, and lichen simplex chronicus. Lichen sclerosus is the most common of these and typically presents with figure-of-eight plaques around the vulva, perineum, and anus with a \u2018cigarette paper\u2019 appearance. Treatment with topical clobetasol is effective. Diagnosis is clinical, but the risk of developing a squamous cell carcinoma in affected skin may be as high at 5%. Raised lesions, persistent ulceration, or lack of response to treatment should prompt a biopsy. Lichen planus is less common and may also involve the vagina, oral mucosa, skin, and nails. It presents in a variety of forms, including thickened white plaques, violaceous papules, and erythematous erosions. First-line therapy is topical steroids. Atrophic vulvitis presents not with white plaques, but with pallor, loss of rugation, petechiae, loss of pubic hair and adipose tissues. Primary treatment is with hormonal therapy and vulvar care with gentle cleansers and avoidance of irritants. Lichen simplex chronicus is often triggered by another problem. It is characterized by lichenification and excoriations caused by the itch-scratch cycle. Treatment involves elimination of irritants, mild topical steroids, and sedating antihistamines at night.\nRed lesions may represent candidal vulvovaginitis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, or lichen planus.

The most common symptoms are itching and burning. Women often delay care and present with a long history of ineffective treatment for presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis. Diagnosis involves recognizing the typical appearance of common conditions and identifying when biopsy should be performed. Therapy is targeted at the underlying etiology. White lesions are seen with lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, atrophic vulvitis, and lichen simplex chronicus. Lichen sclerosus is the most common of these and typically presents with figure-of-eight plaques around the vulva, perineum, and anus with a 'cigarette paper' appearance. Treatment with topical clobetasol is effective. Diagnosis is clinical, but the risk of developing a squamous cell carcinoma in affected skin may be as high at 5%. Raised lesions, persistent ulceration, or lack of response to treatment should prompt a biopsy. Lichen planus is less common and may also involve the vagina, oral mucosa, skin, and nails. It presents in a variety of forms, including thickened white plaques, violaceous papules, and erythematous erosions. First-line therapy is topical steroids. Atrophic vulvitis presents not with white plaques, but with pallor, loss of rugation, petechiae, loss of pubic hair and adipose tissues. Primary treatment is with hormonal therapy and vulvar care with gentle cleansers and avoidance of irritants. Lichen simplex chronicus is often triggered by another problem. It is characterized by lichenification and excoriations caused by the itch-scratch cycle. Treatment involves elimination of irritants, mild topical steroids, and sedating antihistamines at night.

Jenkins, MD\nEditor: Pamela D. Berens, MD\nThe differential diagnosis of a cystic breast mass in a young woman includes benign cyst, fibrocystic changes, fibroadenoma, breast abscess, galactocele, fat necrosis, and malignancy. Evaluation should include history, exam, and ultrasound if necessary. Examination includes the axilla, supraclavicular area, systematic breast exam and evaluation for skin retraction. The size, shape, location, consistency, mobility, and delimitation (presence of borders and edges) are important considerations. The most common etiology of a benign cyst is fibrocystic change, occurring in approximately 50% of women. Breast pain from fibrocystic changes can be cyclical or constant, bilateral or unilateral, or even focal. Physical exam reveals diffuse small cystic masses, described by some as \u201cpeas on a plate.\u201d History and physical is usually diagnostic. Elimination of caffeine-containing foods may improve symptoms. If a discrete mass is present, ultrasound should be performed. Further evaluation is influenced by ultrasound findings. A persistent mass should be biopsied or excised.\nFibroadenomas, are commonly found solid, non-tender masses in young women. They present as firm, mobile, and rubbery masses and may be multiple in 15-20% of cases. Breast imaging possibly followed by biopsy is confirmatory. The mass size, ultrasonographic features and level of patient concern often determine need for excision.\nSimple cysts occur in up to 7% of women. Simple cysts should be mobile, with discrete borders, and feel fluctuant or even \u201celastic.\u201d Ultrasound should be performed to differentiate a simple from a complex cyst. If the cyst is simple, repeat breast exam can be performed in 2-4 months; and the patient returned to routine screening if cyst is stable or resolves. Office aspiration may be warranted if there is severe persistent pain. If the mass is still palpable after aspiration or if it recurs, further evaluation is indicated. Complex cysts may require frequent ultrasonographic follow-up, aspiration or even removal depending on the complexity or radiological features.\nBreast abscesses can be classified as either lactational or nonlactational. The incidence of lactational abscesses in breastfeeding women is 0.1%, and up to 3% in the setting of mastitis. Non-lactational abscesses have been associated with tattoos, nipple piercings, and after radiation or surgery. On exam, erythema, skin warmth and thickening, and tenderness are characteristic. Puerperal abscesses can be managed with antibiotics and serial ultrasound guided aspiration. Incision and drainage may be necessary for larger abscesses or if conservative management fails.\nFat necrosis occurs in <1% of women, usually as a result of trauma. It can also be secondary to injections or placement of foreign substances, including breast implants. Areas of fat necrosis can become fibrotic and appear immobile and diffuse, similar to malignancy. Galactoceles are caused by obstruction of milk ducts, often during weaning. On exam, they are soft, cystic, and typically systemic findings are absent. The diagnosis can be made by aspiration revealing a milky substance. No further workup is necessary.\nMalignancy is uncommon in young women, but thorough evaluation of a breast mass is warranted. Diagnostic mammography can be performed in women over 30 or other if there are other concerning features.

IPV of a minor is child abuse and reporting is mandated in all states. Laws for reporting IPV in an adult vary by state. State specific information is available on the CDC and futureswithoutviolence.org web sites. A woman may gain a sense of control over the situation if involved in the reporting process."

Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) encompass 3rd and 4th degree lacerations.  A fourth degree laceration involves the perineal structures, the external anal sphincter (EAS), internal anal sphincter (IAS), and the rectal mucosa.  A rectal buttonhole tear involves the rectal mucosa with an intact sphincter and may be overlooked without a systematic rectal examination. Failure to recognize and properly repair a fourth-degree laceration poses a risk of infection, wound breakdown, anal incontinence, and fistula formation.\nPooled analysis of data involving 15,366 women with OASIS from 22 studies reported an overall rate of 3rd and 4th degree lacerations of 2.4 %.  Operative vaginal delivery with and without episiotomy and midline episiotomy increased the risk of an OASIS laceration substantially.  The odds ratios (OR) with forceps delivery, vacuum-assisted delivery, and midline episiotomy were 5.50, 3.98, and 3.82 respectively.  When forceps were combined with midline episiotomy, the OR for a 3rd degree laceration was 5.65 and for a 4th degree laceration 10.55.  Other risk factors such as primiparity, labor induction and augmentation, persistent occipito-posterior position, and epidural anesthesia also increased the risk with OR in the 2-3 range.\nSurgical repair of fourth-degree lacerations requires adequate lighting, adequate anesthesia, appropriate surgical instruments, copious irrigation and meticulous attention to hemostasis for optimal wound reapproximation and healing.  Consideration should be given to performing the repair in an operating room setting. \nThe rectal mucosa is repaired in a continuous non-locked suture using a monofilament suture such as polydioxanone (PDS\u00ae) or a braided suture such as polyglactin (Vicryl\u00ae).  Suture size of 3-0 should be used. \nIf the IAS can be identified separately, it should be reapproximated with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl or 3-0 PDS to reduce the risk of post repair anal incontinence.  To reapproximate the EAS, the separated ends must be isolated and grasped with Allis forceps as they tend to retract laterally. There is inadequate data as to whether end-to-end or overlapping reapproximation of the EAS decreases risk of long-term incontinence. This choice may be left to the surgeon\u2019s preference.

Permanent suture should not be used on the EAS.\nThe remainder of the repair to rebuild the perineal body performed like a routine 2nd degree laceration repair.  Rectal examination should be performed after surgical repair to ensure adequacy of sphincter repair and to ensure sutures were not passed through the rectal mucosa.  Prophylactic use of a single dose of cefoxitin or cefotetan administered prior to the repair is reasonable given the consequences of infection and is supported by a randomized trial. \nPostoperatively, women should be counseled to maintain a low fiber, low residue diet and take stool softeners for at least 10 days.  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and acetaminophen are preferred analgesics; oral narcotics should be used with caution because of risk of constipation.

Removal of submucosal fibroids can usually be accomplished by hysteroscopic myomectomy which minimizes disruption of myometrial integrity. Intramural or subserosal fibroids may be removed by laparoscopic or abdominal myomectomy. Laparoscopic procedures require particular attention to ensure adequate closure of the myometrial defect. The estimated risk of uterine rupture following abdominal myomectomy is approximately 0.002%. While this is a low risk, it is likely that it reflects significant selection bias and includes labor in only very specific circumstances. Cesarean delivery is typically recommended after abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy, especially if the removal of the myomas required repair of significant myometrial defects.

External bleeding may not be evident. Clinicians should be watchful for signs of intraabdominal, retroperitoneal and broad ligament hemorrhage.\nIf a sharp curette penetrates the uterine wall, the risk of injury to bowel is dependent on the amount of curetting actions. With immediate recognition and avoidance of any curetting, bowel injury is unlikely. However, intraabdominal injury should be suspected if fat or other tissue is retrieved with the curette. In contrast, a suction curette perforation, even with minimal penetration into the abdominal cavity, can lead to bowel injury. Laparoscopy is usually recommended.

Transvaginal ultrasound shows a 3 cm x 2 cm 7 week size pregnancy within the cervix with a fetal heart rate of 146 BPM. The uterus is empty, and the adnexae appear normal. The \uf062hCG level is 9220 mIU/ml.\nCervical ectopic pregnancy is the rare implantation of a pregnancy in the endocervical canal and accounts for less than 1% of all ectopic pregnancies. Patients usually present with vaginal bleeding which can be profuse and is often painless. Other clinical signs may include a soft, disproportionately large cervix and an hourglass-shaped uterus. The differential diagnosis also includes incomplete abortion, or a pregnancy in a cesarean or hysterotomy scar.\nThe diagnosis is usually made by transvaginal ultrasound. Sonographic criteria include an empty uterus, an enlarged barrel-shaped cervix, a gestational sac within the cervical canal with or without cardiac activity, peritrophoblastic Doppler blood flow to the cervix and an absent \u201csliding sign\u201d, i.e. the intracervical sac fails to slide along the cervical canal when the vaginal transducer is used to apply gentle pressure to the cervix. The presence of cardiac activity and/or peritrophoblastic blood flow to the cervix is strongly suggestive of a cervical ectopic pregnancy. If cervical pregnancy is suspected, subsequent bimanual examination should be avoided.\n\nEarly diagnosis and treatment is critical to avoid serious complications such as severe hemorrhage and the need for hysterectomy. The most appropriate treatment depends on the clinical presentation. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, medical management with systemic single dose or multi-dose methotrexate (MTX) is the therapy of choice. Although cardiac activity is a relative contraindication to MTX treatment, in cases of cervical ectopic, the risk of MTX failure must be weighed against the significant risk of hemorrhage with surgical management. Advanced gestational age, a gestational sac >4 cm, \u03b2hCG level >5,000 mIU/ml, and fetal cardiac activity are associated with a higher failure rate of MTX.\nIf fetal cardiac activity is present, intra-amniotic injection of potassium chloride injection has been associated with successful avoidance of hysterectomy in 80% of cases. Dilation and curettage is a surgical option, but carries a significant risk of severe hemorrhage. Preoperative uterine artery embolization (UAE) may be useful to help control hemorrhage or in the management of bleeding complications.\nIn patients who are hemodynamically unstable or fail medical management, surgical therapy is indicated and requires dilation and curettage. In addition to UAE, the risk of hemorrhage may also be reduced by transvaginal ligation of the cervical branches of the uterine arteries, cervical cerclage, or intracervical vasopressin injection. Postoperative bleeding can often be controlled with tamponade using a Foley catheter, hemostatic sutures in the implantation site, UAE, bilateral uterine or internal iliac artery ligation, or hysterectomy.

The occlusion is seen at the utero-tubal junction, where radiographic contrast fails to enter the isthmic fallopian tube. In a high proportion of cases, the proximal occlusion may be functional. Occlusion is an important finding because tubal peristalsis appears to be necessary for gamete transport. The interstitial portion of the fallopian tube is a complex region anatomically where the myometrium of the uterus transitions into the three layers of muscle that make up the fallopian tube. Instrumentation of the uterus during the HSG procedure often leads to bilateral tubal spasm and non-filling of the tubes. However, the occlusion may be due to a number of pathologic conditions such as acute or chronic salpingitis, salpingitis isthmica nodosa, cornual fibroids, pelvic adhesive disease, endometritis, prior ectopic pregnancy, and adenomyosis.\nMany techniques have been described to overcome tubal occlusion.

Blank, MD","""Ongoing Care of a Woman with Breast Cancer on an Aromatase Inhibitor\n6/1/2013 - Stephanie V. Blank, MD\nEditor:  Pamela D. Berens, MD\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Seventy five percent of breast cancers are termed estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and the majority of these are treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used to treat hormone receptor positive breast cancers in postmenopausal women. In randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, AIs have been found to be more effective in preventing breast cancer recurrence than tamoxifen. Letrozole is a reversible blocker of aromatase that competes with androgens for aromatase, an enzyme present in adipose tissue which converts androstenedione to estrone. Through this pathway, postmenopausal women produce 100mcg of estrone daily, and more if they are obese.\nMost women on letrozole experience controllable side effects. However, in 10-20% of cases side effects necessitate discontinuation. Management of the woman with breast cancer on letrozole should include the control of AI-related symptoms sufficient to allow ongoing treatment as well as quality of life.\nThere are a number of side effects related to lack of estrogen at aromatase-targeted tissue:\nGynecologic:  Aromatase Inhibitors can exacerbate menopausal symptoms. AIs do not increase the risk of endometrial neoplasia, and no specific monitoring is necessary. Women on AIs are more likely to experience vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and decreased libido. While vaginal symptoms can be treated locally, constitutional symptoms generally cannot, and some patients must live with symptoms. The use of vaginal estrogen may be considered in select symptomatic women who fail non-hormonal treatment after review of risks and benefits.\nMusculoskeletal:  Bone and joint issues include decreased bone mineral density, increased fracture risk, and musculoskeletal pain. Women on AIs should have pretreatment evaluation of fracture risk including bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Modifiable risk factors such as smoking, excess alcohol, chronic steroid use, and inactivity should be corrected when possible. Patients should be encouraged to have appropriate calcium intake, diet, and weight bearing exercise to encourage bone health. Other conditions predisposing to bone loss, specifically vitamin D deficiency, should be monitored using 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. If BMD reveals bone loss, bisphosphonates or other appropriate therapy should be started. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected prior to the initiation of bisphosphonates. Bone Mineral Density should be followed yearly in patients on AIs.\nDenosumab is an alternative treatment for bone loss for patients who do not tolerate or respond to bisphosphonates. Denosumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to RANKL, a tumor necrosis factor ligand essential for osteoclast function.\nMusculoskeletal symptoms including arthralgias and joint stiffness are a common reason for discontinuing AI therapy. Risk factors include obesity, prior chemotherapy and pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions. Knees, hands, wrists and shoulders are common sites of pain. Symptoms may be improved by exercise and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\nHematologic and cardiac:  Aromatase Inhibitors do not increase the risk of thrombosis, and a history of VTE is not a contraindication to AI use. Some studies suggest AIs and letrozole, in particular, have a negative impact on cardiovascular health and lipid profiles. This association has not been consistent and may be related to a reduced risk seen in patients treated with tamoxifen.  No additional monitoring is necessary.\n""",Office Practice,6/1/2013,https://s3.amazonaws.com/nareta-articles/audio/575f211362db940300ea04e2/8a3VmEHS5DRO8Kg4o2gs.mp3, 4:00,https://exxcellence.org/pearls-of-exxcellence/list-of-pearls/ongoing-care-of-a-woman-with-breast-cancer-on-an-aromatase-inhibitor,"Breast cancer is a significant health concern among women, with a majority of cases being estrogen receptor positive.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used to treat hormone receptor positive breast cancers in postmenopausal women. In randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, AIs have been found to be more effective in preventing breast cancer recurrence than tamoxifen. Letrozole is a reversible blocker of aromatase that competes with androgens for aromatase, an enzyme present in adipose tissue which converts androstenedione to estrone. Through this pathway, postmenopausal women produce 100mcg of estrone daily, and more if they are obese. Most women on letrozole experience controllable side effects. However, in 10-20% of cases side effects necessitate discontinuation. Management of the woman with breast cancer on letrozole should include the control of AI-related symptoms sufficient to allow ongoing treatment as well as quality of life. There are a number of side effects related to lack of estrogen at aromatase-targeted tissue: Gynecologic: Aromatase Inhibitors can exacerbate menopausal symptoms. AIs do not increase the risk of endometrial neoplasia, and no specific monitoring is necessary. Women on AIs are more likely to experience vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and decreased libido. While vaginal symptoms can be treated locally, constitutional symptoms generally cannot, and some patients must live with symptoms. The use of vaginal estrogen may be considered in select symptomatic women who fail non-hormonal treatment after review of risks and benefits. Musculoskeletal: Bone and joint issues include decreased bone mineral density, increased fracture risk, and musculoskeletal pain. Women on AIs should have pretreatment evaluation of fracture risk including bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Modifiable risk factors such as smoking, excess alcohol, chronic steroid use, and inactivity should be corrected when possible. Patients should be encouraged to have appropriate calcium intake, diet, and weight bearing exercise to encourage bone health. Other conditions predisposing to bone loss, specifically vitamin D deficiency, should be monitored using 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. If BMD reveals bone loss, bisphosphonates or other appropriate therapy should be started. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected prior to the initiation of bisphosphonates. Bone Mineral Density should be followed yearly in patients on AIs. Denosumab is an alternative treatment for bone loss for patients who do not tolerate or respond to bisphosphonates. Denosumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to RANKL, a tumor necrosis factor ligand essential for osteoclast function. Musculoskeletal symptoms including arthralgias and joint stiffness are a common reason for discontinuing AI therapy. Risk factors include obesity, prior chemotherapy and pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions. Knees, hands, wrists and shoulders are common sites of pain. Symptoms may be improved by exercise and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Hematologic and cardiac: Aromatase Inhibitors do not increase the risk of thrombosis, and a history of VTE is not a contraindication to AI use. Some studies suggest AIs and letrozole, in particular, have a negative impact on cardiovascular health and lipid profiles. This association has not been consistent and may be related to a reduced risk seen in patients treated with tamoxifen. No additional monitoring is necessary."

It is responsible for approximately 10-15% of maternal deaths in developed countries. If AFE occurs prior to delivery, the neonatal mortality rate is estimated to be 10-50%. Many surviving neonates suffer neurologic impairment. Neurologic impairment is also common in women survivors, particularly those who suffer cardiac arrest associated with AFE. Although the pathophysiology of AFE is not known, it has been suggested that entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation activates inflammatory mediators causing an anaphylactoid-like response.\nAlthough AFE occurs most commonly during labor and delivery or the immediate postpartum period, it has been reported to occur as late as 48 hours postpartum. The hallmark of AFE is cardiovascular collapse, often with acute dyspnea or cyanosis and tachycardia. Patients may also present with acute severe consumptive coagulopathy without cardiorespiratory symptoms. Risk factors for AFE include advanced maternal age, multiparity, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, diabetes mellitus, and polyhydramnios or other uterine over-distention. Labor abnormalities associated with an increased risk of AFE include precipitous labor, induction of labor, placental abruption, cervical laceration, and uterine rupture.\nThere are 3 phases which have been described during the clinical course of AFE. The first phase involves pulmonary and systemic hypertension with resultant severe pulmonary vasoconstriction, characterized by respiratory distress and hypoxemia, leading to altered mental status followed by hemodynamic collapse. The second phase involves decreased systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular stroke work index. The third phase involves lung injury and coagulopathy, which may include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The results from the tissue injury and end organ system failure seen in AFE with pulmonary vascular constriction often lead to pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure, and global myocardial depression.\nThe management of AFE includes early recognition and prompt multidisciplinary management with anesthesia. Massive blood transfusion protocols should be activated. An operating room, interventional radiology and the Intensive Care Unit should be made available. Laboratory assessment includes arterial blood gas analysis to evaluate the level of hypoxemia, serial blood counts and coagulation studies. An arterial catheter to monitor blood pressure and a central venous pressure catheter can be helpful. The management should focus on oxygenation (airway and breathing) and circulatory support with blood products, judicious use of intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and even cardiopulmonary bypass.

If the woman is postmenopausal or has completed her family, a simple hysterectomy is appropriate. If fertility preservation is important, a repeat conization is required, followed by close surveillance. The consequences of conization on the successful completion of future pregnancies should be discussed. AIS and cervical adenocarcinoma are the most common glandular neoplasias associated with an AGC cytology result. However, many other cancers may be the cause of abnormal glandular cells on cervical cytology. Endometrial lesions are the most common. Cancers of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, and rarely intra-abdominal cancers have also been reported."

Historically, the incidence of ureteral injury ranges from < 0.1% to over 1% depending on the surgery being performed and approach, including laparotomy and laparoscopy. Reported rates of ureteral injury are higher for abdominal hysterectomy than for vaginal hysterectomy. Risk factors include prior surgery, malignancy, infection, a large uterus, endometriosis, and pelvic organ prolapse.\nPrevention of injury is critical; however, there are no well-established methods for most surgical settings. Preoperative stenting has not been generally shown to reduce risk of injury; lighted stents have been described but have not been well-studied in the gynecologic literature. Intraoperative identification is key to avoid injury. Ureteric identification is best accomplished by incising the peritoneum lateral to the infundibulo-pelvic ligament and dissecting the avascular space (peri-rectal space) bounded medially by ureter, laterally by the internal iliac artery, and the cardinal ligament at the apex; the ureter can be traced on the medial leaf of the broad ligament as it courses through to the ureteric tunnel. This dissection will suffice for most gynecologic procedures involving removal of adnexal structures.\nUreteric injuries can be related to kinking, contusion, crush injury, laceration, transection, ligation, devascularization, or thermal injury. Diagnosis is best accomplished in the acute setting, although the majority of injuries may not be diagnosed acutely. If injury is suspected, intraoperative evaluation including careful evaluation for type and extent of injury, cystoscopy and possible ureteral catheterization is indicated. In the acute or near postoperative period, retrograde pyelography is the most sensitive study. If undiagnosed, the most common presenting signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, ileus, possible peritonitis, leukocytosis, and fever. Flank pain may or may not be present.

CT-IVP may be used if these studies cannot be conducted.\nIn gynecologic surgery, the distal aspect is the most commonly injured location, typically near the bladder at the proximity of the ureter and uterine artery. Other locations may include near the pelvic brim and near the utero-ovarian ligament.\nSome injuries, such as incomplete obstruction and kinking, may be treated with stent placement. If suture has caused the obstruction, suture removal may be required. For more significant injuries, including crush injuries and transection, the surgical approach depends on the location. For distal injuries, ureteroneocystotomy is appropriate, in which the distal ureter is re-implanted into the bladder.

Copeland, MD\nEditor: Pam Berens, MD\nREVISED PEARL \u2013 July 2015\nClostridium difficile should be suspected as a cause of acute diarrhea in patients with recent surgery or antibiotic use. Acute diarrhea is usually defined as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools in a 24 hour period. C. difficile infection can also be transmitted from person to person and thus in addition to hand hygiene, immediate isolation and contact precautions should be instituted. Good handwashing alone may be insufficient, so gloves should be used as well. Hand sanitizers are not effective. Risk factors for C. diff infection include extremes in age, prolonged hospitalization, and living in a nursing home. Clostridium difficile may frequently be cultured from asymptomatic individuals without diarrhea in hospitalized patients and those in long term care facilities. Other less common infectious causes of diarrhea (e.g. enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and others) should also be considered in refractory cases. The etiology of acute diarrhea includes a broad differential diagnosis, including infectious causes, the use of bowel stimulants (e.g. magnesium-containing antacids or proton pump inhibitors), intolerance to a specific dietary component (e.g. lactose or gluten), inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption.\nAntibiotics commonly used in the perioperative period (e.g. clindamycin, ampicillin, cephalosporins and quinolones) may result in intestinal overgrowth of the anaerobic organism, C. difficile. This organism produces a cytotoxin and an enterotoxin, which cause the diarrhea. Symptoms include watery diarrhea (several times a day), abdominal cramping and occasionally fever and leukocytosis. In more severe cases pseudomembranous colitis may result, which can rarely progress to a necrotizing colitis, toxic megacolon and possible subsequent perforation with the need for colectomy.

Acute diarrhea is usually defined as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools in a 24 hour period. C. difficile infection can also be transmitted from person to person and thus in addition to hand hygiene, immediate isolation and contact precautions should be instituted. Good handwashing alone may be insufficient, so gloves should be used as well. Hand sanitizers are not effective. Risk factors for C. diff infection include extremes in age, prolonged hospitalization, and living in a nursing home. Clostridium difficile may frequently be cultured from asymptomatic individuals without diarrhea in hospitalized patients and those in long term care facilities. Other less common infectious causes of diarrhea (e.g. enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and others) should also be considered in refractory cases. The etiology of acute diarrhea includes a broad differential diagnosis, including infectious causes, the use of bowel stimulants (e.g. magnesium-containing antacids or proton pump inhibitors), intolerance to a specific dietary component (e.g. lactose or gluten), inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption. Antibiotics commonly used in the perioperative period (e.g. clindamycin, ampicillin, cephalosporins and quinolones) may result in intestinal overgrowth of the anaerobic organism, C. difficile. This organism produces a cytotoxin and an enterotoxin, which cause the diarrhea. Symptoms include watery diarrhea (several times a day), abdominal cramping and occasionally fever and leukocytosis. In more severe cases pseudomembranous colitis may result, which can rarely progress to a necrotizing colitis, toxic megacolon and possible subsequent perforation with the need for colectomy. The condition may be fatal. Patients with suspected C. difficile infections, especially if elderly, should be seen and evaluated for dehydration, shock, and surgical complications. Many of these patients will require admission to hospital for intravenous rehydration and evaluation and correction of electrolyte imbalances.

In obese patients, the needle or trocar can be placed close to 90 degrees from the horizontal plane. At this angle, the distance to the vessels averages 13 cm.\nThe Veress needle should be open when inserted. The surgeon can feel or listen for two clicks (the double click test) as the needle is placed through the anterior abdominal wall (click #1 = anterior rectus sheath, click #2 = the peritoneum). The needle should be freely movable at a fulcrum located within the anterior abdominal wall (waggle test). A drop of saline can be placed in the open needle hub and the abdominal wall lifted (hanging drop test).

This stiffens the anterior abdominal, preventing the umbilicus from being depressed toward the major vessels.\nOpen laparoscopy avoids blind placement by incising the periumbilical fascia and peritoneum and advancing a blunt trocar directly into the peritoneal cavity.

In patients with pain that is not improved with medical management, surgery affords an opportunity for both diagnosis and treatment. Surgical therapy may be conservative or definitive. Conservative therapy may include fulguration, laser ablation or excision of endometrial implants, lysis of adhesions, repair of tubal damage, uterosacral nerve ablation and presacral neurectomy. Excision or ablation has been found to significantly reduce pain symptoms over laparoscopy alone, so endometriosis should be treated at the time of diagnosis. The decision to excise or ablate is based on the location of the lesion and the comfort level of the surgeon. There is no data showing superiority of one modality over the other. In patients with ovarian endometriomas, excision of the entire cyst wall should be performed. Incision and drainage or ablation is not recommended due to the three-fold higher rate of recurrence and reoperation. Pain relief is achieved in most patients who undergo laparoscopic ablation/resection of endometriosis and adhesiolysis. However, the risk of recurrence is estimated to be as high as 40 percent at 10 years follow-up and about 20 percent of patients will undergo additional surgery within two years.\nLaparoscopic surgery and uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) disrupts the parasympathetic ganglia in the uterosacral ligaments, which carry pain signals from the uterus, cervix and other pelvic structures. Randomized controlled trials have shown that LUNA at the time of laparoscopy does not decrease pain, dysmenorrhea, dysparunia or dyschezia, so LUNA is not recommended. Presacral neurectomy (PSN) excises the presacral neural plexus, which carries pain signals from the uterus and cervix. A randomized controlled trial of laparoscopic surgery with or without PSN showed that the severity, but not the frequency of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia was significantly less at 12 months in women undergoing PSN.\nThe term deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) describes infiltrative disease that involves the uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, bowel, ureters or bladder. Medical therapy of symptomatic DIE is usually ineffective or transiently effective, with high recurrence rates. There is no consensus on the extent of resection necessary to treat DIE. Extensive dissection in the rectovaginal septum, rectal or bladder wall, or bowel resection is often necessary. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy alone is inadequate for definitive therapy if endometriosis involving the bowel is left untreated.\nMedical therapy after conservative surgery is recommended for patients with pelvic pain to reduce recurrence of pain and reoperation rates.

The success rate of external version varies between 35-86%, with an average success rate of 58%. When successful, most women will have vaginal delivery. Attempted external cephalic version is underutilized with a rate of 46%. Counseling regarding risks of external version should include fetus reverting to breech presentation, abruption, cord prolapse, rupture of membranes, fetal distress potentially resulting in emergency cesarean delivery and extremely rarely, fetal death. The fetus should be at least 37 weeks gestation and there should be no fetal or placental concerns precluding vaginal delivery. Use of a tocolytic and regional anesthesia may increase success rates. A reactive nonstress test should be obtained before and after the procedure regardless of the procedure\u2019s success. The procedure should be stopped if the patient is too uncomfortable or there is fetal distress. Rhogam should be administered after the procedure in Rh negative women.

Follow up studies show less perinatal morbidity and mortality, but at the expense of an increased cesarean rate. Some small and nonrandomized studies suggest that in appropriately counseled patients, breech vaginal delivery may be safe when strict selection protocols are utilized. External cephalic version (ECV) should be recommended whenever possible when term breech is diagnosed. The success rate of external version varies between 35-86%, with an average success rate of 58%. When successful, most women will have vaginal delivery. Attempted external cephalic version is underutilized with a rate of 46%. Counseling regarding risks of external version should include fetus reverting to breech presentation, abruption, cord prolapse, rupture of membranes, fetal distress potentially resulting in emergency cesarean delivery and extremely rarely, fetal death. The fetus should be at least 37 weeks gestation and there should be no fetal or placental concerns precluding vaginal delivery. Use of a tocolytic and regional anesthesia may increase success rates. A reactive nonstress test should be obtained before and after the procedure regardless of the procedure's success. The procedure should be stopped if the patient is too uncomfortable or there is fetal distress. Rhogam should be administered after the procedure in Rh negative women. External cephalic version > 37 0/7 weeks is preferred. Early ECV (34-35 wks) is associated with higher risk of reversion to breech, preterm labor and possible preterm delivery. Limited data suggest similar successful ECV rates in women with a prior cesarean delivery but the risk of uterine rupture is unknown. When external version is unsuccessful, a planned vaginal breech delivery may be considered in certain circumstances. The physician should be experienced in vaginal breech delivery, aware of hospital policy on delivery of term breech infants and comfortable in counseling the patient and managing complications including cord prolapse and head entrapment. The patient should be informed of the increased risk for neonatal morbidity and mortality with vaginal breech delivery (including prolonged cord compression and fetal birth trauma) compared to planned cesarean delivery. The infant should be 37 weeks or older, have an estimated fetal weight between 2500 and 4000g, and be in a frank or complete breech presentation. There should be an adequate maternal pelvis, normal amniotic fluid index, no fetal anomalies predisposing to dystocia and the fetal neck should not be hyperflexed. Labor induction should be avoided. Augmentation should be reserved for inadequate contraction patterns prior to active phase labor. The fetus should undergo continuous heart rate monitoring and labor progress followed closely. The mother should be allowed to deliver the fetus to the umbilicus. Standard breech maneuvers should be applied for delivery of the arms, shoulders and head. The infant should be rotated to occiput anterior and the neck flexed by applying pressure to the maxilla. Episiotomy may be necessary to allow for adequate room for the maneuvers."

ETIOLOGY
Hypothyroidism is much more common in women than men. It occurs in up to 5% of the population, with approximately 0.1-2% overt and 4.3% subclinical. Hypothyroidism is more common in older adults and may be present in 5-15% of women over the age of 65. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. In the US, the most common cause is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an auto-immune condition in which a goiter is present and the gland is unable to produce sufficient thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism can also be caused by previous surgery or treatment with radioactive iodide for hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease). A transient postpartum thyroiditis can result in hyperthyroidism followed by transient hypothyroidism, or only hypothyroidism, lasting from a several weeks to a few months. Pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypothyroidism) and hypothalamic defects (tertiary hypothyroidism) are also potential causes. Medications to treat hyperthyroidism such as methimazole (tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU), lithium, potassium iodide, and even Lugol’s solution can also cause hypothyroidism.
DIAGNOSIS
Primary hypothyroidism is diagnosed by a high serum TSH with a low serum free thyroxine (T4) concentration, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a normal free T4 in the presence of a high TSH. Secondary hypothyroidism is diagnosed with a low serum T4 and a serum TSH that is not proportionately elevated. Common symptoms include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, and menstrual irregularities. Findings may include bradycardia, cool or dry skin, hair loss, brittle nails, and a delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes.
MANAGEMENT
Once the correct diagnosis is made, treatment of hypothyroidism is typically life-long, as autoimmune thyroiditis is usually permanent. Transient postpartum thyroiditis may not cause symptoms and may not require replacement. The most common form of thyroid replacement is synthetic levothyroxine. Its long half-life and once-daily dosing makes it convenient to take, and it usually provides a predictable response.

Mennuti, MD\nEditor: Christopher M. Zahn, MD\nPregnancy results in a physiologic anemia due to the expanded plasma volume. The red cell mass also expands, but to a lesser degree. Lack of iron supplementation results in a smaller expansion of the red cell mass and a greater degree of anemia, which may be associated with abnormal iron indices.\nAnemia in the presence of normal iron indices may be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic. Microcytic anemia is most commonly related to thalassemias or anemia of chronic disease. Normocytic anemia may also be due to chronic disease as well as bone marrow suppression, chronic renal or endocrine dysfunction, hypothyroidism, and hemolysis, including sickle cell disease. Acute blood loss may result in a normocytic anemia; chronic blood loss will often lead to iron deficiency. Macrocytic anemia may be due to folate or Vitamin B12 deficiency, liver disease or alcohol abuse. Vitamin-linked anemias may be associated with malabsorption due to gastric-bypass procedures or Crohn disease. Vitamin-associated anemias may be confirmed by serum measurement. It is important to ensure adequate iron supplementation in addition to vitamin supplementation.\nThalassemias and sickle cell disease are more common in certain ethnic groups. Sickle cell disease is most common in woman of African origin, \u03b1-thalassemia is more common in those of Southeast Asian, African, and West Indian descent, and \u03b2-thalassemia is more common in those of Mediterranean, Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and West Indian descent. Alpha-thalassemia is due to gene deletion on two or more of the four \u03b1-globin genes. Beta-thalassemia is due to a mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene resulting in deficient or absent \u03b2-chain production. Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders requires hemoglobin electrophoresis. The number and degree of genes affected determines the degree of anemia, which may range from mild and essentially asymptomatic, to severe. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) will be low (<80 fL) in patients with thalassemia trait. For patients with suspected thalassemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis is indicated. Beta-thalassemia is associated with elevated Hb F (fetal hemoglobin) and elevated Hemoglobin A2. Alpha-thalassemia trait has a normal electrophoresis and can only be identified with molecular testing.\nSickle cell disease in pregnancy may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased folate supplementation (4 mg/day) is required due to red cell turnover. Pregnancies affected by \u03b1-thalassemia trait or \u03b2-thalassemia minor are generally not different from unaffected pregnancies. More severe thalassemias in pregnancy (particularly \u03b2-thalassemia major) is uncommon. Hemoglobin H disease may have favorable outcomes. For women with \u03b2-thalassemia major, pregnancy is only recommended in those with normal cardiac function; fetal growth may be at risk.\nBoth sickle cell disorders and thalassemias may carry risk of an affected fetus depending on the presence of mutations in the parents and may benefit from genetic counseling and testing, with possible fetal testing (CVS or amniocentesis) depending on the results of parental testing. In vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be an alternative.\n""",Obstetrics,4/1/2010,https://s3.amazonaws.com/nareta-articles/audio/575f211362db940300ea04e2/pfMpcWppvxvamvBF9DW7.mp3, 3:34,https://exxcellence.org/pearls-of-exxcellence/list-of-pearls/anemia-in-pregnancy-with-normal-iron-studies,"The text discusses anemia in pregnancy with normal iron studies, covering various causes of anemia, including thalassemias, sickle cell disease, and vitamin deficiencies.

Lack of iron supplementation results in a smaller expansion of the red cell mass and a greater degree of anemia, which may be associated with abnormal iron indices. Anemia in the presence of normal iron indices may be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic. Microcytic anemia is most commonly related to thalassemias or anemia of chronic disease. Normocytic anemia may also be due to chronic disease as well as bone marrow suppression, chronic renal or endocrine dysfunction, hypothyroidism, and hemolysis, including sickle cell disease. Acute blood loss may result in a normocytic anemia; chronic blood loss will often lead to iron deficiency. Macrocytic anemia may be due to folate or Vitamin B12 deficiency, liver disease or alcohol abuse. Vitamin-linked anemias may be associated with malabsorption due to gastric-bypass procedures or Crohn disease. Vitamin-associated anemias may be confirmed by serum measurement. It is important to ensure adequate iron supplementation in addition to vitamin supplementation. Thalassemias and sickle cell disease are more common in certain ethnic groups. Sickle cell disease is most common in woman of African origin, α-thalassemia is more common in those of Southeast Asian, African, and West Indian descent, and β-thalassemia is more common in those of Mediterranean, Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and West Indian descent. Alpha-thalassemia is due to gene deletion on two or more of the four α-globin genes. Beta-thalassemia is due to a mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in deficient or absent β-chain production. Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders requires hemoglobin electrophoresis. The number and degree of genes affected determines the degree of anemia, which may range from mild and essentially asymptomatic, to severe. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) will be low (<80 fL) in patients with thalassemia trait. For patients with suspected thalassemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis is indicated. Beta-thalassemia is associated with elevated Hb F (fetal hemoglobin) and elevated Hemoglobin A2. Alpha-thalassemia trait has a normal electrophoresis and can only be identified with molecular testing. Sickle cell disease in pregnancy may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased folate supplementation (4 mg/day) is required due to red cell turnover. Pregnancies affected by α-thalassemia trait or β-thalassemia minor are generally not different from unaffected pregnancies. More severe thalassemias in pregnancy (particularly β-thalassemia major) is uncommon. Hemoglobin H disease may have favorable outcomes. For women with β-thalassemia major, pregnancy is only recommended in those with normal cardiac function; fetal growth may be at risk. Both sickle cell disorders and thalassemias may carry risk of an affected fetus depending on the presence of mutations in the parents and may benefit from genetic counseling and testing, with possible fetal testing (CVS or amniocentesis) depending on the results of parental testing. In vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be an alternative."

Oral contraceptives do not hasten resolution of existing cysts.  Patients with suspected hemorrhagic cysts should be followed if clinically stable and the pain can be managed medically.  Torsion requires prompt surgical intervention to preserve ovarian function. Additional disorders are found in over half of patients with the diagnosis of torsion. Endometriomas generally require surgical removal as medical therapy will not significantly decrease their size.  Neoplasms require surgical intervention, and a gynecologic oncologist should be involved when imaging suggests malignancy. Aydrosalpinx may be managed expectantly if it has the characteristic ultrasound appearance of a sonolucent, elongated, extraovarian structure.

Other relevant laboratory testing may include CBC, gonorrhea and chlamydia, and tumor markers. Imaging is critical in the evaluation and would typically start with ultrasound; MRI or CT may be required. Ultrasound can be transvaginal or transabdominal, with the latter preferred in patients who are virgins. Morphologic scoring systems to assess malignant potential may be used, but have not been validated in adolescents. Ultrasound findings of a sonolucent cyst with smooth walls and the absence of thick septations and solid components indicate a low risk of malignancy. MRI is the preferred imaging modality after an initial ultrasound for suspected vaginal and uterine anomalies. Management of functional cysts is expectant with serial ultrasound imaging. Oral contraceptives do not hasten resolution of existing cysts. Patients with suspected hemorrhagic cysts should be followed if clinically stable and the pain can be managed medically. Torsion requires prompt surgical intervention to preserve ovarian function. Additional disorders are found in over half of patients with the diagnosis of torsion. Endometriomas generally require surgical removal as medical therapy will not significantly decrease their size. Neoplasms require surgical intervention, and a gynecologic oncologist should be involved when imaging suggests malignancy. Aydrosalpinx may be managed expectantly if it has the characteristic ultrasound appearance of a sonolucent, elongated, extraovarian structure. Ectopic pregnancy may be managed with methotrexate or surgical intervention. Anomalies resulting in menstrual outflow obstruction are managed surgically. Paratubal and inclusion cysts appearing as extraovarian, sonolucent structures that may be followed with serial ultrasound imaging."

Tamura, MD\nEditor:  David Chelmow, MD\nREVISED PEARL - February 2015\nGastroschisis and omphalocele are the most common fetal ventral abdominal wall defects.\nOmphalocele is a midline ventral abdominal wall defect through which abdominal contents herniate.  The defect generally occurs at the base of the umbilicus, with the umbilical cord inserting at the apex.  It is covered by amnion and peritoneum.  Large omphaloceles may contain the fetal liver as well as other abdominal organs. Chromosomal abnormalities occur in up to 60% of fetuses with omphaloceles that do not contain liver.  Omphaloceles may be associated with amniotic band syndrome, Pentalogy of Cantrell, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and cloacal exstrophy.  Up to 50 % of omphaloceles are associated with cardiac defects.  Gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and CNS abnormalities can also be present.  Fetuses with small omphaloceles can be delivered vaginally while those with defects larger than 5 cm are typically delivered by cesarean.  Primary surgical closure is usually performed for smaller omphaloceles. Silos, elastic bandages and epithelialization with delayed surgical repair are used for larger defects.\nGastroschisis results from a full thickness defect in the ventral abdominal wall.  Loops of intestine are seen within the amniotic fluid without overlying membrane.  Bowel and genitourinary abnormalities are associated with gastroschisis.  There does not appear to be an increase in chromosomal abnormalities.  Fetuses with gastroschisis can be delivered vaginally at or near term.  Immediate repair and closure lessens problems such as infection, hypothermia and acidosis.  Primary closure is possible when the bowel can be returned to the abdominal cavity (80% of cases).  Otherwise, a silo is used to protect the bowel, and surgical repair is performed later.\nPentalogy of Cantrell is characterized by a median supraumbilical abdominal wall defect, defect in the sternum, diaphragmatic pericardial deficiency, anterior diaphragmatic deficiency and intracardiac defects.  It has been associated with cystic hygroma, cranial defects and chromosomal abnormalities.\nBody stalk anomaly is generally lethal.  It is characterized by cranial, midline facial, thoracic, abdominal wall and limb defects.  By ultrasound, the intrathoracic and abdominal organs may be seen outside of the body cavities within a sac covered by membranes and directly attached to the placenta with an absent or shortened umbilical cord.  The associated scoliosis and omphalocele may appear as an amniotic band syndrome.\nCloacal exstrophy may present with hypogastric omphalocele, meningomyelocele, bladder herniation, scoliosis, and abnormalities of the renal and genitourinary system.  A single umbilical artery is often associated, as are spinal and skeletal defects.  Bladder exstrophy occurs at a lower level compared to cloacal exstrophy and may include defects of the bladder and urethra as well as diastasis of the symphysis and malposition of the anus.  The diagnosis of both types of exstrophy is excluded by a normal urinary bladder.  Surgical correction is undertaken to prevent ascending infection, incontinence and prolapse.\nUrachal abnormalities result in a communication between the anterior abdominal wall and bladder.  They may appear as a complete or partially patent urachus, urachal diverticulum, urachal sinus or cyst.  A communication between the bladder and a cystic mass confirms a patent urachus.  Urachal anomalies are corrected surgically with good outcomes.\nSeveral characteristics allow distinguishing between these defects.  Umbilical cord insertion into the apex of the defect suggests omphalocele.  Insertion to the side suggests gastroschisis, while below suggests ectopia cordis and above suggests exstrophy.  Gastroschisis is associated with higher levels of maternal serum alphaprotein levels than omphaloceles or neural tube defects.  Visualization of an overlying membrane differentiates an omphalocele from other defects.

Zahn, MD\nREVISED PEARL - July 2016\nHydrops fetalis is the presence of excessive fluid in two or more fetal compartments including skin edema, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites and polyhydramnios. Fetal hydrops can be immune or nonimmune. Ninety percent is nonimmune.\nNonimmune hydrops fetalis (NHF) presents as uterine size greater than dates due to polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movement, fetal compromise on fetal testing, and ultrasound findings. The diagnosis is made when increased amounts of fluid are seen in at least two fetal compartments. Ascites is an early sign and must be differentiated from pseudoascites. Pleural effusions may be unilateral or bilateral. Skin edema is usually a late sign and subcutaneous or scalp edema of greater than 5 mm is pathologic. Polyhydramnios is present in the majority of cases. The placenta may be abnormal in appearance (intervillous edema) and in thickness (thicker in certain infections or thin or compressed with polyhydramnios).\n50% to 85% of etiologies can be determined antenatally, while 10% are idiopathic. Some common etiologies are:\n1. Aneuploidy is found in about 10% of cases. Monosomy X is the most common chromosomal cause. Trisomies 21, 18, 13, other very rare trisomies, and tetraploidy/triploidy are associated with most of the remainder. The prognosis is poor and NHF likely results from fluid accumulation due to cystic hygromas, obstruction or abnormalities in the lymphatic system, or cardiac defects. Certain genetic syndromes may also be associated, including skeletal dysplasias.\n2. Fetal metabolic storage diseases cause hydrops due to accumulation of metabolites in the liver and other abdominal viscera that cause congestion. Recurrence in this setting may be as high as 25%.\n3. Cardiovascular anomalies account for 40% of cases. Common intracardiac structural defects include hypoplastic left heart and isolated ventricular and atrial septal defects. Tachy- and bradyarrhythmias may cause high or low output cardiac failure. Vascular abnormalities including chorioangiomas of the placenta, fetal tumors, hemangiomas, umbilical cord aneurysms and obstruction of the vena cava, portal vein, or femoral vessels can cause high output failure.\n4. Thoracic abnormalities such as congenital adenomatoid malformations of the lung increase intrathoracic pressure and obstruct venous return to the heart, resulting in peripheral venous congestion. Lymphatic obstruction may cause lymphedema.\n\n5. Anemia from hemorrhage, hemolysis, defective red cell production or abnormal hemoglobin production accounts for up to 25%. The pathogenesis involves high output cardiac failure. Hydrops may resolve in some cases when the anemia is corrected.\n6. Congenital Infections with toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes (TORCH) organisms, parvovirus B19, syphilis, varicella, adenovirus and coxsackie virus cause up to 8%. The mechanism is not clearly understood with all infections. Parvovirus causes hemolysis, hepatitis, and myocarditis.\n7. Gastrointestinal tract anomalies such as midgut volvulus result in ascites, edema and polyhydramnios.\n8. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in monochoroionic twins may result in NHF.\nEvaluation includes:\n\u2022 Patient history regarding ethnicity, genetic abnormalities, metabolic diseases, and recent exposure to infections\n\u2022 Ultrasound examination for structural defects\n\u2022 Doppler assessment for middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity for detection of anemia\n\nLaboratory tests include:\n\u2022 Complete blood count with RBC indices\n\u2022 Blood type and screen\n\u2022 Serologic evaluation for infection\n\u2022 Kleihauer-Betke acid elution\n\u2022 Fetal karyotype\n\u2022 Amniotic fluid assessment\n\u2022 Umbilical blood sampling as indicated\nManagement depends on the cause. Mortality can be high and depends on gestational age at onset, presence of pleural effusions and polyhydramnios. Management may include pregnancy termination, therapeutic interventions when appropriate and supportive care as needed.
